Functions
=========

Functions in Illumina is just like functions from most programming languages. After being defined, it can be invoked with a list of parameters (possibly empty), and will return an value (unless the return type is :code:`void`).

Function definitions cannot be nested, and must be defined at the outmost scope (directly inside the file) or inside a class definition.
